# Increase productivity: iTerm2 + oh my zsh + solarized + Meslo powerline font

[My terminal] (./dailyTerminal.png?raw=true)

Do you wish terminal can do more in your daily develpment? I believe the above combination can help you increase productivity. With the more features and custom setting, iTerm2 really makes my life easier. oh my zsh provides good themes and plugins in the terminal. Finally, solarized keeps my eyes healthy. The meslo powerline font is useful if you want to use the agnoster theme in oh my zsh. Enjoy.
